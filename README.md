# Data Wrangling - Data Processing


### 1  Goals
Data preprocessing might not be the most fascinating part of data science, but it is a necessary step to obtain reliable results. It often accounts for most of the time required by a proper data analysis. In this course, we teach the basics of data wrangling and cleansing. By data wrangling, we mean the ability to manipulate data in a quick and efficient way based on a compact code, to change the shape of a dataset according to oneâ€™s needs using functions tailored for that objective. More specifically, we will explore the most important functions of packages like dplyr or tidyr, in R. Regarding Data preprocessing, we will teach students how to deal with missing values, to identify outliers and abnormalities often encountered in databases, in order to treat them in a relevant fashion. They apply the content of the course on a real-life dataset on PhD defenses drawn from theses.fr.
